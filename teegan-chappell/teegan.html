                        Personally golf is my favorite sport, so I created a website about it. You will learn all about golf and how to do it.

                        What it is:
                        <p>
                        All you have to do is hit a ball into a hole using a golf club. The ball goes a certain distance depending on what club
                        you use. The clubs range from driver to putter. You use a driver of the tee, and a putter on a green. </p>
                        <p> There are multiple
                        places your ball can end up: you will always start on the Teebox, when you hit your ball of the teebox you want your
                        ball to be on the Fairway or the Green. The fairway has short grass so it is easy to get your ball up into the air. the
                        green is where you putt your ball to get it into the hole. Those are the places you want to be... here are some you 
                        don't: The Rough, the rough is an area next to the fairway, the rough is the exact opposite of the fairway, the rough
                        is an area with long grass and it is really hard to get your ball to go a far distance. The Bunker: The bunker is a sand
                        pit... so its pretty self-explanatory. Your ball sinks in and it is really hard to get out, and if you do it probably
                        didn't go very far.The water: well obviously. If you land in the water 1. you lose your ball and 2. you get an extra
                        stroke (shot). </p>
                        <p> The less strokes you have the better. </p>
